"""Tests for the auction snapshot.

The contract worth defending is not the arithmetic - the engine columns come from the harness and are
tested there - but the SEPARATION: an `engine_*` column is a gated valuation and a `desc_*` column is
not, and a sheet that blurs the two is how an ungated rule ends up in a decision. Plus the two dates
that make a dry run honest: the auction date must never be after the season it pretends to price.
